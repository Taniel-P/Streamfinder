  summary: 'Elle Woods has it all. She\'s the president of her sorority, a Hawaiian Tropic girl, Miss June in her campus calendar, and, above all, a natural blonde. She dates the cutest fraternity boy on campus and wants nothing more than to be Mrs. Warner Huntington III. But, there\'s just one thing stopping Warner from popping the question: Elle is too blonde.',

  reviews: [{username: 'gnawbone', rating: '7.0', date: '10-07-2021', content: 'An entertaining movie that with the title alone alerts you that it is brazenly silly, though Reese Witherspoon\'s character Elle Woods has challenges that make you cheer for her. Awkward social situations are well handled by the character and credit to the writers and director for resolving these with good morals. All of the major cast roles are well done.'}],
